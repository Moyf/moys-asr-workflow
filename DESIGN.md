# MAWE Design System

This file is the minimal design contract for the MAW editor UI. It extracts the
implicit patterns already present in `web/editor.css` and `web/editor-template.html`
so new components stay consistent without inventing new tokens. It is intentionally
small: the editor is a single dark-theme tool, not a multi-product design system.

## 1. Design tokens (extracted from existing CSS)

All values are already in use; do not introduce new ones without extending this table.

| Token | Value | Used by |
|---|---|---|
| `--bg-player-empty` | `#171d23` | `.player-wrap.empty-state` background |
| `--border-player` | `#34414e` | `.player-wrap.empty-state` border |
| `--bg-overlay-text` | `rgba(0,0,0,0.65)` | `.subtitle-overlay span` background |
| `--color-overlay-text` | `#fff` | `.subtitle-overlay span` text |
| `--overlay-radius` | `4px` | `.subtitle-overlay span` radius |
| `--overlay-font` | `clamp(14px, 2.5vw, 26px)` | `.subtitle-overlay span` font-size |
| `--overlay-shadow` | `0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.8)` | `.subtitle-overlay span` text-shadow |
| `--accent-focus` | `#5ea7ff` | focused inputs / focus ring |
| `--handle-size` | `12px` | resize handle hit area (new) |
| `--handle-color` | `#fff` | resize handle fill (new, opaque only on show) |

The overlay container itself is transparent; only the inner `<span>` carries the
dark translucent pill. This is preserved by the geometry work: the container is the
movable/resizable box, the `<span>` stays centered inside it.

## 2. Subtitle overlay geometry model

The overlay (`#overlay`) is positioned absolutely inside `.player-wrap`. Its
geometry is persisted as normalized fractions of the player-wrap rect so it
survives player resize and cross-machine transfer without absolute pixels.

```json
{
  "preview": {
    "subtitle": { "x": 0.0, "y": 0.76, "width": 1.0, "height": 0.16 }
  }
}
```

- `x`, `y` — top-left corner as a fraction of player-wrap width/height, clamped to `[0, 1]`.
- `width`, `height` — box size as a fraction of player-wrap width/height.
- `width >= 0.20` and `height >= 0.08` (minimum readable box).
- `x + width <= 1` and `y + height <= 1` (box stays inside the player).
- Legacy default (when `preview.subtitle` is absent): `{ x: 0, y: 0.76, width: 1, height: 0.16 }`
  — this reproduces the original `bottom: 8%` band: the box spans 76%→92%, leaving
  an 8% bottom gap, with the text span vertically centered inside.

The geometry is applied to `#overlay` as `left/top/width/height` in `%`. The inner
`<span>` keeps its existing `max-width: 90%`, centering and pill styling, so the
visible text rendering is unchanged when the box is at the legacy default.

## 3. Interaction states for the overlay

Handles and focus affordances are **hidden by default** and revealed only when the
overlay is being used. This keeps the subtitle preview visually identical to the
legacy rendering when the user is not editing it.

| State | Class on `#overlay` | Visible |
|---|---|---|
| idle (hidden text) | `hidden` | nothing |
| idle (showing text) | — | only the text pill |
| hover / focus / dragging / resizing | `editable` | 8 resize handles + dashed outline + focus ring |

- `#overlay` gains `tabindex="0"`, `role="group"`, and an `aria-label` that exposes
  drag, Arrow/Shift/Alt, Enter/Space, and Esc controls to assistive technology.
- Pointer drag on the box body moves it; pointer drag on a handle resizes.
- Keyboard: with focus, Arrow keys nudge position by 1% (10% with Shift);
  `Alt+Arrow` resizes (Alt+Left/Right adjust width from the east edge, Alt+Up/Down
  adjust height from the south edge). `Esc` blurs; `Enter`/`Space` toggles `editable`
  for keyboard users.
- One undo record per gesture (pointer-down → pointer-up, or one keyboard nudge),
  pushed at gesture start with the pre-gesture snapshot.

## 4. Constraints carried over from AGENTS.md

- No new external assets, fonts, or icon libraries. Handles are CSS-drawn squares.
- Local server stays on `127.0.0.1`; geometry persistence goes through the existing
  `/api/project` save + `maw.project.normalize_project` round-trip — no new endpoint.
- Segment timing (`segments[*].start/end/items[*].start/end`) is never touched by
  preview geometry code.
